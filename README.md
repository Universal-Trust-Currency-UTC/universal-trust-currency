# Universal Trust Currency
We propose a Universal Trust Currency (UTC) as a transformative concept for promoting secure, efficient, and collaborative interactions in multi-agent systems. The UTC enables agents to earn, spend or exchange trust tokens based on their demonstrated reliability, cooperation, and task performance. These tokens serve as both a measure of trustworthiness and a medium for incentivizing positive behavior, supporting a more transparent trust management system. Unlike traditional trust management systems, which rely on trustors to independently evaluate the trustworthiness of trustees, the UTC allows trustees to actively demonstrate their reliability by sending (paying) trust tokens to trustors as a tangible and verifiable commitment. The UTC aims to address the challenges of decentralized trust management by providing a scalable and transparent mechanism to promote cooperation and mitigate malicious behaviors. We outline the potential benefits of adopting this model, including enhanced accountability and scalability, while identifying key challenges and research directions for its implementation.
